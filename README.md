## What is CLI?

CLI stands for Command Line Interface. It allows users to interact with the operating system by typing commands into a terminal. Unlike graphical user interfaces (GUIs), CLIs offer a more direct and efficient way to control your system, especially for repetitive tasks.

## Key Topics

### CMD

The Command Prompt (CMD) is a built-in Windows application that allows users to execute commands. Here are some basic commands to get you started:

- `dir`: Lists the files and directories in the current directory.
- `cd`: Changes the current directory.
- `copy`: Copies files from one location to another.

### PowerShell

PowerShell is a more advanced command-line shell and scripting language. It is designed for system administration and automation. Key commands include:

- `Get-Process`: Displays a list of all running processes.
- `Set-ExecutionPolicy`: Changes the user preference for the PowerShell script execution policy.
- `Get-Service`: Retrieves the status of services on your machine.

### Winget

Winget is the Windows Package Manager. It allows you to install, upgrade, and manage software packages from the command line. Common commands are:

- `winget install <package>`: Installs a specified package.
- `winget upgrade`: Upgrades all installed packages.
- `winget list`: Lists all installed packages.

### Chocolatey

Chocolatey is a package manager for Windows. It simplifies the installation of software. Here are some commands you can use:

- `choco install <package>`: Installs a package.
- `choco upgrade <package>`: Upgrades a specific package.
- `choco uninstall <package>`: Uninstalls a package.

### Batch Scripts

Batch scripts are text files that contain a series of commands to be executed by the command line. They can automate repetitive tasks. A simple batch script might look like this:

```batch
@echo off
echo Hello, World!
pause
```
